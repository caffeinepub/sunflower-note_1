# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a minimalist, responsive single-page “Sunflower Note” experience with a centered sunflower bouquet hero and an elegant glassmorphism note overlay.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page responsive layout with a solid #FAFAFA background and vertically/horizontally centered hero content.
- Add a centered, realistic sunflower bouquet hero image (static asset) with a subtle looping “breathing” scale animation (~1%–2%).
- Add an “Open Note” button and allow clicking the bouquet to open a centered overlay note card.
- Style the note card with glassmorphism (backdrop blur ~10px, thin semi-transparent white border, rounded corners) and modern sans-serif typography (Inter or Montserrat), center-aligned with generous line spacing.
- Render the provided note content exactly as given; blur the bouquet/background slightly when the note is open; ensure smooth open/close transitions.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a centered sunflower bouquet on an off-white page, can click the bouquet or “Open Note” to reveal a frosted-glass note with the exact message, with elegant animations and background blur for focus.
